An atom is the smallest part of a chemical element that retains the chemical properties of that element. The word atom has its origin in the Greek word atomos, meaning indivisible. He believed that nothing is smaller than an atom. An atom consists of a cloud of negative charges (electrons) hovering around a very small positively charged nucleus in the medium. This positive nucleus is made of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. An atom is the smallest part of an element that it can distinguish from other elements. As we dive deeper into matter to encounter smaller structures, there will no longer be a difference between one element and another. For example, there is no difference between a proton in an iron atom and another proton in a uranium atom, for example, or an atom of any other element. Corn, with its properties; The number of its protons, its mass, its electronic distribution ..., make the differences between the different elements, between the different forms of the same element (called isotopes), and even between whether this element is able to undergo a chemical reaction or not. Under the structure of the atom and what is going on in this tiny world, it has kept scientists busy and pushes them to discover more. From here, new branches of science began to appear, carrying with them their own principles and theories, starting with the principle of uncertainty, passing through the major theories of monotheism, and ending with the theory of superstring. Atomic theory is concerned with studying the nature of matter, and states that all matter is composed of atoms. Dalton's theory: This theory included several hypotheses, the most important of which is that matter consists of very small, non-divisible minutes called atoms. The most widely accepted theory to explain the structure of the atom is the wave theory of the electron. This conception is based on Bohr‚Äôs conception, taking into account recent discoveries and developments in quantum mechanics. Which states: the wavelength function of the hydrogen electron orbital. The principal quantum number on the right of each row and the spindle number are shown as a letter at the top of each column. Until the end of the nineteenth century it was widely believed that the atom was a small, indivisible body of an element. With the discovery of the electron by the incarnate scientist Thompson in 1897 through his famous experiment with the oil point experiment, the way was opened to discoveries greater than that that took about 35 years until scientists were able to decipher the last secrets of the atom around 1930. Then scientists began to devote their attention to studying and explaining the structure of the atomic nucleus itself. A purely new sport that must be devised, and that new sport should take into account the characteristic of wave-particle duality of the electron. During the years 1923 - 1926, the German scientist Heisenberg and the Austrian scientist Schr√∂dinger succeeded separately in devising two new mathematical methods based on the wave nature of the electron. Heisenberg relied on the calculation of matrices. As for Schr√∂dinger, his method depended on wave mechanics, and these two methods were called quantum mechanics. 2n2, meaning that the n = 1 shell contains 2 electrons, the n = 2 shell has 8 electrons, the n = 3 shell contains 18 electrons, and so on. The secondary quantum number l is related to the principal quantum number n by the relationship l = 0, 1, 2, ... <n - 1. It forms what is called below the shells or orbitals, and determines the number of electrons in each orbit by the relationship 2 (2l + 1). l = 0 and it is called an s orbital and it can contain 2 electrons. l = 1 and it is called a p orbital and it can contain 6 electrons (the second and upper shell) l = 2 and it is called a d orbital and it can contain 10 electrons (the third and upper shell) l = 3 and it is called an f orbit and it can contain 14 electrons (the fourth and upper shell) ) And so on . Hydrogen: the number of electrons 1 and occupies the orbital 1s1 helium: the number of electrons 2 and occupy the orbital 1s2 lithium: the number of electrons 3 and occupy the orbitals 1s2 2s1 beryllium: the number of electrons 4 and occupy the orbital 1s2 2s2 boron: the number of electrons 5 and occupy the orbitals 1s2 2s2 2p1 And they occupy the orbits 1s2 2s2 2p6 and so on. It is noted that the inert elements such as helium and neon are characterized by completely full shells, helium has a first shell filled with 2 electrons and neon has two shells, the first is filled with 2 electrons and the second shell is filled with 2 + 6 electrons, and this is the secret of its inactivity. The next element of neon is sodium and it has 11 electrons, in which the first ten electrons are distributed exactly as in neon, while the electron number 11 occupies the orbital 3s1, so we find that sodium has a large chemical activity, and its electron number 11 is an electron valence. The magnetic quantum number ml takes values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom l to l -, and the spin quantum number ms, which takes the values ‚Äã‚Äã1/2 or 1/2 -. Scientists have had to enter these two quantum numbers to explain the phenomenon of the division of the spectrum lines under the influence of an external magnetic field, and this effect is known as the Zeeman effect, which was discovered by the Dutch scientist Zeman, as well as the lines of the spectrum split under the influence of an external electric field, and this effect was discovered by the German scientist Stark and called his name the Stark effect. By this, it was possible to determine the state and energy of each electron in the atom by four quantum numbers: n, l, ml, ms, with complete accuracy. This is completely identical to the Pauli exclusion principle formulated by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, which states that two quantum bodies, such as an electron, cannot occupy the same quantum state in the atom. We find that the two electrons in the helium atom, for example, occupy the orbital 1s2 and have the same quantum energy, but one of the electrons takes the spin state 2/1 = ms, and the second electron takes the spin state 2/1 - = ms. And it can change its orbit from the inside to the top when it gains energy from the outside. This acquired energy is expelled in the form of a photon ((quantum)), that is, in the form of a beam of a specific frequency and thus specific energy, when the electron jumps from the energy level of the upper orbit to the energy level of a lower orbit, as in the figure. The size of an atom cannot be easily determined as the electron orbitals are not fixed and their size changes by the rotation of the electron in them. But for atoms that are in the form of solid crystals, the distance between two adjacent nuclei can be determined and thus an estimate of the size of the atom can be made. For atoms that do not form solid crystals, other techniques are used that include estimation calculations. For example, the size of a hydrogen atom was roughly calculated as 1. 2 x 10?10 m. Compared to the size of a proton, it is the only particle in the nucleus of a hydrogen atom 0. 87 x 10?15 m. Thus, the ratio between the volume of a hydrogen atom and the size of its nucleus is approximately 100,000. The sizes of the atoms of the different elements change, and this is because the elements that have more positive charges in their nuclei attract electrons more strongly towards the nucleus. Each element, meaning an atom of each element, carries its own number of protons (known as the atomic number), and this number of protons is not shared by other elements. For example, the element sodium carries eleven protons, and if you meet an element that carries eleven protons, be sure that you are in front of the sodium element or at least in front of one of its images. Atoms with the same atomic number share many physical properties and follow the same behavior in chemical reactions. The different types of elements in the periodic table are arranged according to the increase in atomic number. The atomic mass in its simple sense is the sum of the masses of the components contained in an atom. It represents the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons as well as the electrons, but because the mass of the electrons is very small, it is neglected, and it is taken by the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons. (For a definition of the atomic mass of the element, see below). The atomic mass is measured in the atomic mass unit amu (wk y), where the mass of the proton is 1 and. K . Approx y, and x is the mass of the neutron. Thus, we can estimate the atomic mass of an element through our knowledge of the number of protons (Z) and the number of neutrons (N) that it consists of, and knowing that the mass of each of these nuclear particles (nucleons) is equal to one atomic mass unit, the mass of an atom is equal to The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in units of atomic masses. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons equals the mass number (A). Here we can write the following relationship:, where Z denotes the atomic number and N denotes the number of neutrons. An element may exist in different forms called isotopes, as each of them has the same atomic number (that is, they represent the same element), but they vary in their atomic masses based on the difference in the number of neutrons among them. To distinguish these isotopes, the element name is written, followed by 1 proton as well. Deuterium is this element found in nature. Atoms are electrically neutral when the number of positive charges (protons) they carry is exactly equal to the number of negative charges they contain (electrons). When an atom loses or gains electrons, it turns into ions. When an atom gains electrons, its negative charge exceeds its positive charge and thus turns into a negative ion because the number of electrons in it has become more than the number of protons. When the atom loses electrons, it turns into a positive ion because the number of protons in it has become more than the number of electrons. The atoms in nature do not usually exist freely (with the exception of atoms of the inert elements), but they are found in chemical compounds combined with other atoms, whether they are the atoms of the same element or the atoms of other elements. The oxygen atom, for example, does not usually exist in a free form. Rather, it binds to other oxygen to form the oxygen molecule in the air that we breathe, or it combines with two hydrogen atoms to form a water molecule, and so on. The chemical behavior of an atom is largely due to the interactions between electrons. The electrons in the atom are in a specific and expected electronic form. The electrons are located in certain energy shells according to the remoteness of those coatings from the nucleus (see "Atomic structure"). The electrons in the outermost shell are called valence electrons, which have a great influence on the chemical behavior of the atom. The inner electrons play a role but it is secondary due to the positive charge effect present in the nucleus of the atom. Each envelope of energy is arranged in ascending order starting from the closest shells to the nucleus, which is numbered by number 1. n "is the coat number, (the main quantum number) and the electrons are strengthened by first filling the energy levels close to the nucleus. And the last shell with the electrons is the valence shell even if it contains only one electron. The explanation for occupying the inner energy shells first is that the energy levels of the electrons in the shells near the nucleus are much lower than the energy levels of the electrons in the outer shells. Accordingly, in the case of an incomplete inner energy envelope, the electron in the outer envelope travels rapidly to the inner envelope (and emits radiation equal to the energy difference between the two envelopes). The electrons in the energy outer shell control the behavior of the atom when chemical bonds are made. Therefore, atoms with the same number of electrons in the outer energy envelope (valence electrons) are placed in one group on the periodic table. The group is a column in the periodic table, and the first group is the one that contains one electron in the outer energy shell, the second group contains 2 electrons, the third group contains 3 electrons, and so on. As a general rule, the fewer the number of electrons in a plane in the valence shell of the atom the more activity the atom increases. Thus, the first group metals are the most active elements and most of them are cesium, rubdium, and francium. The atom is more stable (less energy) when its valence shell is full. This can be achieved by the following: An atom can contribute electrons to neighboring atoms (a covalent bond). Or it can remove electrons from other atoms (an ionic bond). The process of moving electrons between atoms makes the atoms bonded together. This is known as chemical bonding, and through this bonding, molecules and ionic compounds are built. There are five main types of bonds: [Using the theory of inflation, the number of atoms in the universe ranges from approximately 4 ◊ 1078 and 6 ◊ 1079. In general, since the universe is infinite, the number of atoms can also be infinite. This is not inconsistent with the number that was calculated since the universe under study is within 14 billion light-years. The atom plays a very important role in industry, including the nuclear industries, industrial materials science, and also the chemical industries. The atom has been the focus of scientists for decades. The atomic theory had a great influence on many branches of science, such as nuclear physics, spectroscopy and almost all branches of chemistry. These days, the atom is studied in the fields of quantum mechanics and sub-atomic particles. The study of the atom was done without direct intent in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and in the current years, and with the emergence of new technologies, the study of the atom became easier and more accurate. By using the electron microscope discovered in 1931, single atoms were photographed. New methods have also been developed to identify atoms and compounds. For example, mass spectrometry is used to determine atoms and compounds . GMS "Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry" is also used to identify materials. And also to confirm the presence of certain atoms or molecules by means of x-ray crystalography. Democrats and Lyseobus, ìGreek philosophers of the fifth century B.C.î, made the first assumptions about the atom. It was assumed that each atom has a specific shape, such as small stones, and this shape is what governs the properties of that atom. And Dalton proved in the 19th century that matter consists of atoms, but he did not know anything about its composition. This assumption was opposed to the theory of infinite division, which held that matter can always be divided into smaller parts. During this time, the atom was considered to be the smallest part of matter, and this assumption later changed to that the atom itself consists of subatomic particles and the electron was discovered by Thomson's experiment and it was the first particle to be discovered. This proved that an atom could split. Rutherford's discoveries also helped prove the existence of the nucleus and that it carries a positive charge. And all recent studies of the atom take into account that the atom is composed of subatomic particles. Since the time of Democrats, many views have been proposed for the composition of the atom, including: While Democratís theory has been completely proven wrong, many modern theories are based on similar ideas such as shape and vibration. These ideas are similar to the properties of subatomic particles. The word corn comes from the Greek word atomos, meaning indivisible. Up until the 19th century when Bohr's conception was presented, it was believed that atoms are extremely fine and indivisible particles.
