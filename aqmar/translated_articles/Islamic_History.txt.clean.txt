Islamic history extends over a long period of time that covers most of the Middle Ages over a wide geographical area extending from the borders of China in Asia to West Asia and North Africa to Andalusia. And Islamic history can be considered to extend from the beginning of the Islamic call after the revelation of the Prophet Muhammad bin Abdullah, then the establishment of the Islamic state in Medina, through the Umayyad state in Damascus, which extended from the borders of China to the Pyrenees in the north of Andalusia and the Abbasid state, with what these Islamic countries included from Emirates, Selakat, and countries such as the Seljuks and the Buyids and in Morocco the Idrisids and the Almoravids then the Almohads and in the Levant Hamdani and the Zangid and others, finally in the Fatimid Egypt and in the Levant and Egypt such as - the Ayyubids and the Mamluks and then the control of the Ottoman Empire, which is considered the last empires that were ruling in the name of Islam Illnesses span a wide geographical area. From the beginning, Islam was distinguished as more than one religion that regulates the relationship between God as a creator and between man as a creature as most other religions do. The Messenger of Islam Muhammad bin Abdullah, from the beginning of the revelation (the Holy Qur’an), established Muslims in the form of a group that emerged from the days of Meccan persecution to develop into Society and what is similar to the state in Medina. And there in Madinah the revelation continues, regulating the relationships of individual Muslims (immigrants and supporters) between each other and with members of other religions (Jews in Medina), and all this makes Islam a collective religion par excellence, so that its entire worship is based on the idea of ??community and solidarity in society. In addition to defining man’s relationship with the Creator and Nature, which makes it a religion with two sides: spiritual, religious, and sociopolitical. The views that attempt to explain and interpret Islamic history, in all its complexities and momentum with events, revolutions and unrest, differ according to the ideological backgrounds that analysts adopt and the analytical tools they use. In the modern era, after the so-called Era of Awakening, there were clear tendencies by historians known as nationalists to interpret Islamic history as pure Arab history. At the same time, we also see communist historians tend to see political and military tensions in the entirety of Islamic history with a Marxist viewpoint that prevails over economic factors and The class struggle is above all other considerations. As for the secular historians, they were trying their best to prevent the religious factor from being included in the interpretation of events. Their efforts were focused on re-exploring the so-called pre-Islamic history, given that the seeds of the Arab renaissance began in that era, and Islam is nothing but the seed of development in Arab thought. Among all this disagreement over the interpretation of events, historians with an Islamic orientation remained struggling to prove the uniqueness of Islam as a religion that brought about a social and civilized revolution that gave the Arabs their state and civilization, and this is an indisputable fact and they emphasize the tolerance of Islam and the arrival of many other Islamic races to power. These historians also confirm that the mission of the Prophet Muhammad bin Abdullah was a milestone that caused a revolution in the history of the region as a whole in particular and the world in general. But the main weakness is that they then present a description of the events without explaining them. Some Sunnis stress not to go into the details of the fitna and disagreement between Muawiya and Ali, considering the two companions, and both of them are forgiven, while the other group of Sunnis and the group confirms Muawiyah’s mistake in breaking out Ali, and they prove Ali's eligibility in terms of his election and pledge of allegiance. On the other extreme, the Shiites stand for their well-known position of supporting Ali and his family in the succession of the believers with the report of the Messenger of God Muhammad bin Abdullah, making the caliphate a legitimate affair, unlike the Sunni theory, which makes the caliphate a political matter on which Muslims agree and convene by pledging allegiance. Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Douri is unique in presenting an early interpretation of Islamic history that depends on several theories and depends on a combination of several factors in the interpretation of Islamic history. The factors that play a major role can be classified according to the interpretation of Dr. Al-Douri to: Dr. Abed Al-Jabri adopts a similar classification in his book The Arab Political Mind: where he studies Islamic history according to three axes: (belief, tribe, and booty). He also introduces strange inputs from habits of judgment and Persian, Greco-Roman traditions. Arabia before the advent of Islam was a group of Bedouins (nomads) or civilians (people of villages and residents of small cities) organized into tribes. Loyalty to the tribe and its alliances is considered the basis for organizing the Arab society (mostly Bedouin) (the concept of Asabiyah). The vast majority were pagan, in addition to Jewish and Christian minorities, and Mecca was a religious center that Arabs came from all directions to perform the pilgrimage to the Sacred House built by Ibrahim. It was in this atmosphere that Muhammad appeared to speak out about Islam, and the most important political influence of Islam was that he was able to establish a state in Medina where legislation governing everyone, documents and treaties with the Jewish minority that inhabited the city. Later, the Muslims were able to defeat the polytheists in several battles, and Mecca was conquered two years before the death of the Messenger of God, thus destroying the idols of the Arabs that were present in the Kaaba and declaring monotheism. The monotheism that Islam brought was not only religious, spiritual, but also sociopolitical, as the entire Arabian Peninsula entered into one belief and became for it one entity and one qibla and one deity, which is God. Whereas, tribal factions and material ambitions in that period temporarily weakened before they reappeared after the Muslims achieved important victories to bring down the Sasanian state and conquer the Levant. The Prophet Muhammad bin Abdullah died in 632 AD, leaving Muslims with clear rules of religion and the book of God, the Qur’an, but the issue of managing the ummah’s political affairs was not clear and agreed upon by everyone, so the first dilemma Muslims would have faced was the issue of succession or the leadership of the ummah and It is an issue that is still in dispute to this day between the two broad groups: Shiites and Sunnis. Some of the supporters of Ali bin Abi Talib believed that Ali (the cousin of the Prophet and the husband of his daughter, who was the first to embrace the children without puberty, Abu Bakr was the first of men to embrace Islam, and Khadija was the first to embrace women, as Ibn Katheer achieved it in the beginning and the end) as The most deserving of succession to the Messenger, but many other opinions were put forward. The supporters were demanding the price of their victory over the Messenger and their accommodation for the immigrants by choosing a successor from them, and the majority of the immigrants believed that this matter could only be held by someone from the Quraysh, and the negotiations ended in the shed of Bani Sa`ida to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr successor . Abu Bakr received the caliphate of the Ummah in a delicate stage, as the absence of the Messenger Muhammad bin Abdullah encouraged many Arab tribes that declared their allegiance to Islam to declare disobedience and try to break the authority of Medina by refusing to pay zakat, while others declared their apostasy from Islam and many appeared Prosecutor of prophethood in different parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Abu Bakr knew directly that such movements threaten the unity of the nation and religion, and his response was directly through a group of military campaigns against the apostate tribes known as the wars of apostasy. The Caliphate of Abu Bakr only lasted two years, three months and eight days, during which he was able to quell the movement of apostasy and leave the city’s authority. Before his death, the succession problem returned again, so what was from Abu Bakr only resolved it through the will to Omar bin Al-Khattab, who became caliph. The rule of Umar ibn al-Khattab lasted ten years, six months and nineteen days during which most of the early Islamic conquests, especially the conquest of the Levant, Mesopotamia and Egypt, defeated the Byzantine and Sasanian presence in the Levant, Iraq and Egypt. During the reign of Umar ibn al-Khattab, the Muslims stormed the sea and defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Dhat al-Sawari. All this made the Islamic state turn into the beginning of a sprawling empire that included many lands, peoples and peoples. Money poured into Medina and the revival of economic life, which actually raised the fears of the Commander of the Faithful, who was known for his asceticism and justice, and despite what Omar knew of justice, which is reflected in many stories (The story of Ibn Amr bin Al-Aas with the Copt: When did you enslave people and when their mothers gave birth to them free The complete collapse of the Sasanian state caused severe anger among some Persians, which would cause Ibn al-Khattab to be killed by Abu Lu'lu`a. Before the death of Ibn al-Khattab, he understood a new method in choosing the next caliph that would rid him of the responsibility of choosing, which would be a unique application of the principles of shura that Islam prompts: What was one of his life except that he chose a group of six people (they are the remaining ten who are evangelized in Paradise). People who had the pleasure of God and His Messenger and ordered them to meet after his death to choose the successor of the Muslims. The matter of the caliphate was confined to the first session of the shura between Ali bin Abi Talib, may God bless him and Othman bin Affan, which prompted the matter to conduct a referendum in Medina by Abd al-Rahman bin Auf and its result was in favor of Othman bin Affan, and many historians indicate that the people had Ibn Al-Khattab's austerity policies were bored and she was afraid that a new ascetic like Ibn Abi Talib would continue to rebuke them from enjoying new wealth, while Ibn Affan is already rich and pious, so he sees no harm in enjoying what God has bestowed upon him. Historians usually divide the caliphate of Othman bin Affan (twelve years) into two parts: six good years and six years of turmoil and strife. The first six years were followed by the invasions and the Islamic armies continued to advance in North Africa and Central Asia. As for the last six years, they were marked by the emergence of unrest, especially in regions such as Iraq and Egypt. And it seems that new economic matters and social complications arising from the formation of new societies: immigrant Arab tribes, indigenous peoples, Islamic armies, previous civilizations in the new open lands have begun to exert their effects in these six years. The protesters against Othman’s policy were referring to privileges obtained by his relatives from the Umayyads in addition to a group of legitimate criticisms. These objections continued until it ended with the sedition of Othman’s murder, which was the first internal strife that befell Muslims. The Commander of the Faithful, Ali bin Abi Talib, assumed the reins of the caliphate after a swift pledge in Medina, to face a crisis situation in the Islamic state after the killing of Othman. The main problem is that Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan accused some of his supporters of participating in the killing of Uthman. For this reason, Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan did not bless the pledge of allegiance to Ali, and he was a ruler of the Levant with a possible influence in his capital, Damascus, and its surroundings. After a short period, Ali bin Abi Talib, may God bless him, moved his command center to Kufa, where his supporters gathered, moving away from Medina, and after that he would enter into a conflict with Talha bin Ubaid Allah and Al-Zubayr bin Awam, and with them Aisha in the Battle of the Camel, winning in the end Despite his hatred for this victory. Ali is trying to regain control of the Levant by confronting Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan in the Battle of Safeen, which will end without a solution, and an agreement on the issue of arbitration between Muawiyah and Ali. But the issue of arbitration in which the two opponents were represented: Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and Amr ibn al-Aas, after which this group would leave the army of Ibn Abi Talib and would be called later on by the Kharijites, who break the consensus of Muslims. The Kharijites will later turn into the staunch opponents of Ali, may God bless him, who will defeat them with several battles, the most important of which is the Battle of Nahrawan, but in the end he will be killed by a man among them called Abu Maljam. (11 AH - 13 AH / 632 AD - 634 AD) The wars of apostasy are the wars that occurred after the death of the Messenger of Islam Muhammad due to the conversion of the majority of Arabs from Islam, so nothing remained loyal to the rule of Abu Bakr except for the tribes surrounding Medina in addition to the inhabitants of Medina, Makkah and Taif. Caliph Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq decided to fight all the apostates, and he did not leave any of them, although some of the Companions directed him to leave the tribes who refrained from paying Zakat. So he sent the Islamic armies led by Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl to fight Luqit bin Malik in Dibba and he fought him until he was killed in the battle. And then Khalid bin Walid to fight Musaylimah liar . Khalid defeated Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama, which was one of the harshest battles fought by the Muslims. This era begins with the advent of Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan, who is considered the first founder of the Umayyad state, which formed the largest empire in Islamic history from Central Asia and China to central Europe and the borders of France, and its capital was Damascus, the rule of Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan extended for twenty years. He became famous during his reign as the post office, and it became the post office, as he was the first to establish the postal system among Islamic countries and from his capital, Damascus, the starting point. There were special centers that had a special interest from the Caliph, and the invasions expanded and most of them were towards Turkey. Perhaps he would be the caliph who conquered Constantinople and launched Muawiyah at the top of the Muslim flag. And he annexed more of the country to his state. After him came his son Yazid, who had continued to complete his father’s journey in strengthening the Umayyad Islamic State. After that, the caliphate moved to Marawan bin Al-Hakam, who fought dates and turned the scales on all the outlaws, and was on their head Al-Zubayr, and wars began between them led by the leader Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf Al-Thaqafi and he in turn launched his campaign against Ibn Al-Zubayr until Ibn Al-Zubayr left until the people were killed and people were happy with his killing. By God, until Abdullah bin Omar said, and the obstacles on the way to the Umayyads were ended, so they completed raising the banner of Islam and consolidating the foundations of the Islamic state, and after the death of Marwan bin Al-Hakam, his son Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, who is considered the actual founder of the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus, expanded the rule and consolidated the pillars and pillars of the state and was justified in His rule, and he had a great deal of influence, spreading knowledge and preserving the state’s ties as it expanded in all directions towards the East and West. Abd al-Malik bin Marwan was interested in architecture and established places of worship and scientific schools in Damascus and other Islamic countries. Long life and in his era the Umayyad state flourished and the banner of Islam rose in countries that were not Islamic before the Umayyad rule, and he attracted scholars, thinkers and jurists to the court of the capital of his state, Damascus, and worked to spread Islamic culture in all its faces and throughout the Islamic countries. After Abd al-Malik bin Marawan, he was succeeded by his son Al-Walid bin Abd al-Malik, who followed the course of the powerful Umayyad state, following his father’s approach to embracing knowledge and scholars, and recalling that the most prominent events in his reign were the conquest of Andalusia in the year 95 AH and the expansion of the Umayyad state, and the issuance of the Islamic Umayyad currency. And his care for the Islamic cities was great. And after the death of Caliph Al-Walid bin Abdul-Malik, he was succeeded by Suleiman, the strong caliph, and the most prominent thing he did was to bring him closer to his cousin, Omar bin Abdul Aziz bin Marawan bin Al-Hakam. After Solomon succeeded him, the just caliph Umar bin Abdul Aziz, who soon returned all the grievances to their people, until the people almost said, “My family is old by collecting grievances.” He stood one day and said to them: O my illiterate son, I think that splitting the ummah’s money is in your hands, and he ordered that all of it be returned to God. Omar . Omar bin Abdul Aziz was just in wisdom, and after Omar bin Abdul Aziz, the caliphate took over Yazid bin Abdul Malik, and after him Hisham bin Abdul Malik, in the midst of the expansion of the Umayyad state, and during his reign we can say the beginning of the end of the Umayyad state, after several intrigues by the outsiders on the Islamic consensus And the emergence of the Kharijites revolution, which was eliminated and subjugated, despite the intrigues by the outsiders from the Abbasids, the Umayyad state continued to raise the banner of Islam. And after the death of Hisham bin Abdul Malik and the continued rule of the governors throughout the country, and after several intrigues, conspiracies and treachery known by the Abbasids against the entity of the Islamic State, and after a time the fall of the Umayyad state in 137 AH, which is the largest and most important Islamic state and empire in Islamic history, and later a caliphate was established. New in Andalusia under the leadership of the great leader: Abd al-Rahman bin Mu’awiya bin Hisham bin Abd al-Malik, who grew up in the House of Government in Damascus and defeated the Abbasids who stood in the face of the Umayyads and defeated them and established the Umayyad state in Andalusia, which was one of the most important countries of civilization, science and an Islamic beacon in Europe. After the Umayyad state, which expanded its conquests in every direction and was the largest empire in the history of Islam, the Abbasid state was established, but it did not preserve the strength and expansion of the Islamic state, thus losing many of the countries that the Umayyads had conquered, and after that several Muslim states or states emerged in Iraq, the Levant, North Africa, Egypt, the Hijaz and others.
